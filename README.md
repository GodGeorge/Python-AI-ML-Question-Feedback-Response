# Jacaranda-Health-Interview

1) We edited the training model of the ML since the questions were in a wrap text in Excel and placed each question on a separate cell with the corresponding intent
2) We used openpyxl binaries and hence its a prerequisite for the module to run correctly.
3) Since the training set only had the intent and the question, we assumed a generic priority for nutrition as low and a generic response.
4) The script is a full sentence search functionality and matching entire questions as per the training set. 

Would have loved to employ one-word, multiple word search,Â  similar word search functionality so that all areas are covered but will be engaged for tomorrow and Sunday due to family commitments and thus will be short of time.
In case of any clarifications feel free to contact me.
